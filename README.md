Hi, I'm @Azzy-Glitch 👋

I'm interested in... 🤔 Exploring the vast world of programming languages and becoming a proficient coder. I'm fascinated by the endless possibilities that coding offers, and I'm eager to learn and master new languages and technologies.

I'm currently learning... 📚 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++ to improve my problem-solving skills and become a more efficient coder. I'm excited to apply my knowledge to real-world projects and collaborate with others to learn from their experiences.

I'm looking to collaborate on... 🤝 Projects that involve innovative uses of coding languages, such as machine learning, web development, or game development. I'm open to working with others to build something amazing and learn from their expertise.

How to reach me... 📱 Want to chat about coding or collaborate on a project? You can reach me at: ✉️ aapppp742@gmail.com 📱 +92 3125262421 (WhatsApp) 📸 not_abdul_aziz (Instagram)
